SISD - Single Instruction Single Data
SIMD - Single Instruction Multiple Data
MISD - Multiple Instuction Single Data
MIMD - Multiple Instruction Multiple Data

Amhdal's Law
• T(1) : Time taken for a job with 1 processor
• T(N) : Time taken for same job with N processors
• Speedup S(N) = T(1) / T(N)
• S(N) is ideally N when it is a perfectly parallelizable program, i.e. data parallel with no sequential component
• Assume fraction of a program that cannot be parallelised (serial) is f and 1-f is parallel
• S(N) = T(1) / ( f * T(1) + (1-f) * T(1) / N )   Only parallel portion is faster by N
• S(N) = 1 / ( f + (1-f) / N )

10% of a program is sequential and there are 100 processors. What is the effective speedup ?
S(N) = 1 / ( f + (1-f) / N )
S(100) = 1 / ( 0.1 + (1-0.1) / 100 ) = 1 / 0.109
= 9.17 (approx)
