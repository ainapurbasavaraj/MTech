#create host file with all the node details
cat host_file 
node1
node2
node3

each node should have ssh connection established in order for MPI to access the node.

create executable with mpiCC -o helloworld helloworld_mpi.c

Copy the 'helloWorld' executable across all the nodes in the cluster.
Run below command to execute helloworld on the cluster

mpirun -n 4 -hostfile host_file helloworld

Hello world from processor node1, rank 0 out of 4 processors
Hello world from processor node1, rank 1 out of 4 processors
Hello world from processor node3, rank 3 out of 4 processors
Hello world from processor node2, rank 2 out of 4 processors

Here process 1 and 2 running on node1 and 3, 4 running on node2 and node3 respectively.
